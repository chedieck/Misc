# Misc
Simple and silly scripts that make my life more enjoyable.
-
`fetcher.py` -> fetches relevant network information, can be used with polybar

`recorder.py` -> script to handless record audio on telegram-desktop, can be used to play guitar

`fix_keyboard.sh` -> utility to reconfigure keyboards after physically disconnecting them


# Traps
`mousefuck.py` -> makes the mouse circle around the middle of the screen. Useful to setup some shortcut traps (:

`hydra.sh` ->  opens up another insance of the active window. I personally set up my ALT+F4 to run this, so that instead of closing the window, it opens another one. A trap, but also useful sometimes.
